# Getting Started

This document will describe how to get started with ZDragon

## Download the Compiler

- [osx](https://github.com/Baudin999/car-lang/releases/download/v0.1.1-beta/ckc)
- [Windows](https://github.com/Baudin999/car-lang/releases/download/v0.1.1-beta/ckc.exe)
- [Linux](https://github.com/Baudin999/car-lang/releases/download/v0.1.1-beta/ckc-linux)

Pre-Release (v0.2.1-beta):

- [osx](https://github.com/Baudin999/car-lang/releases/download/v0.2.3-beta/ckc)
- [Windows](https://github.com/Baudin999/car-lang/releases/download/v0.2.3-beta/ckc.exe)
- [Linux](https://github.com/Baudin999/car-lang/releases/download/v0.2.3-beta/ckcl)

After downloading the compiler you can use it directly or you set the executable in your PATH
variable. I personally use a mac and I put the `ckc` tool in my `/usr/local/bin` because this is the
right location for these kinds of tools.

On a Windows machine I'd advice creating a directory in your `Program Files` called `zdragon`,
putting the downloaded `ckc.exe` in this folder and adding this folder to your path. You can find a
tutorial on how to do that [here](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).

> NOTE: We're working on an installer which should make ckc easier to set up. For now there is still
> some manual work involved.

## Creating your first Project

Now that you've downloaded the compiler and set up your local path variable so that you can call the
compiler from every location we can start building our first project.
